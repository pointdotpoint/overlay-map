module NightMap

// The soak harness's commands, overlaid into the scripts only during a campaign (tools/soak/builds.py); never shipped.
// tools/soak/runner.py sends one command at a time and reads the answer as a "done" state. redscript's annotations
// can't target classes defined in scripts, so the bootstrap calls this directly and NightMapSystem's Soak_* methods are
// spliced into the staged class from SystemBody.inc, which gives them its private fields.
